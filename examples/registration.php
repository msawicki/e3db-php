/**
 * This program provides a simple example illustrating how to programmatically
 * register a client with InnoVault and e3db. In some situations, it's preferable
 * to register a client from the server or system that will be using its
 * credentials (to ensure that all data is truly encrypted from end-to-end
 * with no possibilities of a credential leak). For more detailed information,
 * please see the documentation home page: https://tozny.com/documentation/e3db
